## About application

In this application we have views in html to display all books we have in our database, delete positions or edit them. The data for our program is stored in a database called `book` in a table `books`. An SQL insetion query for your convinience has been added up to the project in SQL file under the name `insertion.sql`.

Within this project I used:
> - Spring
> - Hibernate
> - Dependency Injection
> - Import and use of external libraries like Lombok.
